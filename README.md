# Eleven-Sorting-Algorithms
The program runs 11 sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, ShellSort, Binary Insertion Sort, Shaker Sort, InterchangeSort. And compares the time running between these algorithms.
The input is random int number.
You can change the input size in main.cpp
You can comment out some "slow" algorithms in the test_sort() function in InOut.cpp file to see fast algorithms running.
