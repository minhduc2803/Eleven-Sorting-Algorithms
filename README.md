# Eleven-Sorting-Algorithms

The program runs 11 sorting algorithms: 

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- ShellSort
- Binary Insertion Sort
- Shaker Sort
- InterchangeSort

And compares the time running between these algorithms.

The input is random int number.

You can change the input size in main.cpp

You can comment out some "slow" algorithms in the test_sort() function in InOut.cpp file to see fast algorithms running.
